## [Description](#table-of-contents)
The Employee Tracker command-line application is a simple content management system for any company’s employee database. Using node.js, MySQL and console.table the business’ employee database is organized into departments, roles and employees which are easily viewed and managed through a list of choices generated by inquirer. The user is able to select from a number of options: view all departments, view all employees, view all employees sorted by department, view all roles, add a department, add an employee, add a role, delete a department, delete an employee, delete a role, and update an employee’s role. When any “view” choice is selected, the user is presented with a formatted table containing only pertinent data. When an add, delete or update function is selected, the user is presented with some additional prompts prior to executing their command and being presented with the revised table for their reference. A 'cancel' option has been included in any delete function, so that the user can opt out of removing any data from their database; if chosen, they are notified that no data has been removed from the table and are presented with all table data for reference.
